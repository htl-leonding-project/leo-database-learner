== Manual

=== DB

First you have to open the *leo-database-learner-project* in any development environment.
We used the *IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate* environment. Make sure you use Linux or MacOS.

Then open your terminal and make sure that the path is correct:

e.g.

----
/Users/user/Desktop/project_itp/leo-database-learner/leo-database-learner-project
----

After this you have to write the following into your terminal:


==== Linux / MacOS

===== start db
----
cd ./docker
docker-compose up --build -d
----

or you can use a script

----
./run-db.sh
----

===== stop db

----
docker-compose down
----

==== Win

===== run db
----
cd ./docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose-volume.yml up --build -d
----

or you can use a script

----
run-db.bat
----

===== stop db

----
docker-compose down
----

Click on "+" in the database window. Then select the following (as shown in the picture)
and create 2 PostgreSQL databases:

*Studentdb*

So make sure that everything looks exactly like this and the password is *app*.
Then test the connection and if everything works it should look like the picture.

image::startdb02.png[]

*Operativedb*

So make sure that everything looks exactly like this and the password is *app*.
Then test the connection and if everything works it should look like the picture.

image::startdb03.png[]


If you have updated the docker-compose and nothing changed try this:

----
docker-compose up --build
docker-compose down
docker volume prune
----

=== Backend

Check if you are in the backend folder.

----
~/leo-database-learner/leo-database-learner-project
----

To start the backend project enter following code into the terminal:

----
./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev
----

=== Frontend

Check if you are in the frontend folder.

----
~/leo-database-learner/leo-database-learner-frontend
----

To start the backend project enter following code into the terminal:

----
