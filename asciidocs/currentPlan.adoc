== Plan for the second term

In the second term we are going to work on testing the entered SQL statements and compare if they get along with the solution.

Basically, the plan is that the SQL statement for the sample solution is taken from the operational db.
Since we are working in small steps, we will "hardcode" this first.
The SQL statement from the operative db is executed on the student db and the resulting outcome is saved as a result set.

The student's SQL statement is also executed and the result is also saved in a result set.
If this statement cannot be executed, it should be handled with exception handling.

The two result sets are then compared for number of rows, number of columns or general equality.
