== Manual

First you have to open the *leo-database-learner-project* in any development environment.
We used the *IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate* environment. Make sure you use Linux or MacOS.

Then open your terminal and make sure that the path is correct:

e.g.

----
/Users/user/Desktop/project_itp/leo-database-learner/leo-database-learner-project
----

After this you have to write the following into your terminal:


*Linux*

----
./docker/docker-compose up --build
----

*MacOS*

----
cd ./docker
docker-compose up --build

----

Click on "+" in the database window. Then select the following (as shown in the picture)
and create 2 PostgreSQL databases:
