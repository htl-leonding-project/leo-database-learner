==  Project name
LeoDataBaseLearner

== Problem / project trigger / pre-project
After the time, students lose track of what they have learned.
After a test, the teacher has to check the students' SQL commands individually for correctness, as there are basically several possible solutions.

Pupils constantly ask teachers to provide new exercises, but this is usually not possible for teachers due to time constraints.

Checking the individual SQL statements is also associated with a lot of work for the teachers.

== Task
Creation of a software product for students and teachers at the HTL Leonding.
The system consists of 3 functions. Students can choose whether they want to practice coding, learn or be tested.
The exam tasks can be created by teachers using the system. An evaluation of the tasks should then take place.

Regarding the layout, 3 modules should be visible:

*	text / instruction
*	coding
*	evaluation

The learning progress should be documented on a bar.

== Requirements
=== Functional requirements
- Users can practice SQL, PL / SQL, etc.
- Student performance can be determined through exams
- Teachers can conduct tests with students in class
- Users can see their own learning progress and knowledge level
- Teachers can see the learning progress and level of knowledge of their students
- Teachers can upload exercises

=== Non-functional requirements
- Robustness of the application against user errors (For example: refusal of SQL injections by the user)
- quick feedback from the system
- no check for e.g. JDBC, i.e. for project connections in Java, C ++, C #

== Project goals
The entry into the HTL should be made easier for pupils by being provided with such a practice platform.
It should also be a relief for teachers, as they no longer have to create each exercise themselves.
There is also a uniformity of what has been learned.

== Project risks
- Database crashes
- Misunderstandings about requirements
- System failures
- Communication difficulties

== Project phases / Milestones
- get to know technologies
- create a data model
- create user interface
- create / upload exercises
- edit / delete exercises
- create test

== Project start
2.10.2020

== Project end
December 2021/January 2022

== Project resources
=== Personnel:

- 15PV(Project Manager)
v.p@example.at
- 19SM
- 22TI
- (DC)

=== Material:
- Database
- Server

=== Other expenses:
- much time ;)
